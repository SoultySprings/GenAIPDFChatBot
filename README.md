# Smart Support Chat Platform

This is a real-time support chat platform where human agents are assisted by an AI Copilot. The system features a modern, responsive UI and integrates Google Gemini for intelligent suggestions and sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Built with Socket.IO for instant communication.
- **AI Copilot**: Integrated with Google Gemini to assist human agents with suggestions.
- **Smart Chat Management**: Auto-titling, message history persistence, and session management.
- **Modern UI**: Polished interface built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.
- **RAG Integration**: Knowledge base retrieval for accurate AI responses.

## flexible Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (JavaScript)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **AI/LLM**: Google Gemini
- **Database**: ChromaDB (for RAG)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js & npm
- Google Gemini API Key (set in `backend/.env`)

## Setup & Running

1. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Create virtual environment (if not exists)
   python -m venv ../venv
   # Activate virtual environment
   source ../venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows (Git Bash)
   # OR source ../venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Project**:
   We have provided a convenience script to run both services and open the browser automatically.
   
   **Windows**:
   Double-click `run.bat` or run in terminal:
   ```powershell
   .\run.bat
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Activate the Python virtual environment.
   - Start the FastAPI backend server (port 8000).
   - Start the React frontend development server.
   - Automatically open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

- `/backend`: FastAPI application, RAG service (using `backend/chroma_db`), and WebSocket logic.
- `/frontend`: React application, components, and UI logic.
- `run.bat` / `run_project.ps1`: Scripts to launch the entire stack.
- `backend/chroma_db`: The active vector database directory.

## Maintenance & Troubleshooting

- **Log Files**: `backend.log` and `frontend.log` in the root directory are generated during runtime to capture server output. They can be safely deleted when the server is stopped.
- **Python Cache**: `__pycache__` directories are automatically generated by Python and can be deleted if needed, though they speed up subsequent runs.
- **Stopping Services**: The terminal window running `run.bat` allows you to stop all services by pressing any key. If windows persist, you can manually stop `node` and `python`/`uvicorn` processes.
